# Session 2: Grids and Automation

This tutorial is mostly enacted through a weaving series of p5 sketches, interactive visualizations, and helpful excalidraw diagrams ðŸ˜…

## 1. In the Beginning

In the beginning, we had manual labor â€” we did the repetitious work of laying things out on the screen! Here is a simple version of Molnar's Squares, done manually by calling the `rect` function nine times.

This is okay, but it makes experimentation quite difficult and tedious. What if we wanted to expand our painting to encompass more squares? or draw each square multiple times?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dBFp0mZFN0hN_Vj8k5Py3r7yPj7Wli7gMKlLFxlwlqXPCfNCZuB2MXcVn-cfkb6ncUA33acNHAQC2c0g6gX-Xy645OnRngfdT8vOsdOY3qej_YJgAx6GA2tpxHwvMJfVm3nfrUJx2yB7_i2tKSFzWDjg=s800-no)

To do this, we need to break down the process of making these squares. What would it look like to do this by hand?

Perhaps we'd go row-by-row and draw each square:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cw2e0XLwMWFaXhzkSmgzbTENbTG-7pOYu1uvO5IRcKE-j4Ojav0qpO7P41pkJLrMFJPhGJ5ZM_hSH_ugEamvwtPyP2Lk0Cg8YsaMriLEsiwvDwyf-bk-OBhRXTKxH5gAR_pgu3i1D_xVGcSgHI6bAY0g=s800-no)

And if we managed to encode this **process** of drawing a bunch of squares in a grid format, we could easily go from a 3x3 grid to a 10x10 grid by describing the **variables** that we are interested in: the number of rows, and the number of columns.

To do this, we'll need to talk about automation in programming.

## 2. Automation and The Number Line

In general, automation in programming comes in the form of for-loops.

Code:

```js
for (let y = 0; y < 400; y += 10) {
  console.log("y = ", y)
}
```
Output:

```js
y = 0
y = 10
y = 20
...
y = 390
```

[Sketch example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/T0iYDDR_0)

There are lots of different ways to visualize this! You can think of it like a number line:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cKRpWYODwX3_C4ytEDq6xVbhSOwFqk0UDJJZPsC-UAhNxDH3qqA7dYqopqsE98yTf4QkB8g8l_cszkzMedrmslp_MNuog32aydnufbNiR62NXhxWY3Y4s208oPIHISLnX1ZT7rA6-t6f1Yu_EMbzhrJQ=w1582-h452-no)

Where we define a variable, `y` that:

- starts at 0 (`let y = 0`)
- goes to 390 (`y < 400`)
- and changes in increments of 10 (`y += 10`).

Here is that same logic broken down next to the number line:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dAmjgVDEnjL7y5mIqzb0_wWkVxAfV7dd1DOGuyt8sspLO4ceVxOcoddwVlCh2xrJDnAljWTo7VIFs-t0ppGbEK_hXnL5r2v-csALFj9-8nYiTwvEoWWri8Av9wZXIZ2MVf7M5OxxSpwznlZgZB-47hcA=w1602-h658-no)

In this way, we can see that the first two components define the "number line":

```js
let y = 0; y < height;
```

and the last component defines the rate of change:

```js
y += 10
```

## 2b. Alternative Mental Models

In terms of logic that we've already talked about, we can think of it as:

- Defining a variable, `y`, which starts at 0
- Creating an "if" statement that loops over and over again:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3elgXSPbmbIuRJQOVxssb9f4LcInQ4Bpt39wV_GXBr_dxlOkP1Ogx6HGHDdV7A6unaVmV-qYGf8SJpGPHOfA8Ym3KlvTX0t3n4_wp4lWxhIzTKSkDHuao6GXZw-I9mvjCs5wFCSjQhx6Dyftcg2kXI6YA=w1264-h1050-no)

But this is kinda abstract! Instead, I try to consider the actual _output_ of the code, which is essentially a **list of values** for `y`.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3d0ZV3Tb-xZReS-9l9TwZ9nBn3TKV5bSbxgvsPWjWUWJ42zr83TQqKdLvfXJ9XE65fj_tA0UWNRKgqE4HAO_cl-Ynsg_vp6maFqeeEk1k1bCPwsPnwy1IL6NiJMGXmeQaeoOBrZPdAp9xl21pufjK_fcA=w1430-h574-no)

In fact, we could write out this list of values manually in JavaScript and use that instead:

```js
// Define all of our values
let yValues = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

// Go over the list of values and call it `y` in each iteration.
for (let y of yValues) {
  console.log("y = ", y)
}
```

Output:

```js
y = 0
y = 10
...
y = 60
```

## 3. Working with Grids

Now that we've covered for-loops, we can use it to break down our canvas into a grid space.

Take this process for example:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3exaFYVOXFEaAfYb1gLdbHtaQ-P6ewASYg9Dz4shGFS5o_O3LTXbHMzuvX-mb_Yegw05_8WC-Pm4bGf5MvLXJKMWS1IcC6rrXTCvwwP7780ME_qzgAQDP54hGlykYZow3WQA4On6wV8B_9c_mmyl-FGTg=s400-no)

We can imagine this as two separate for loops:

- one for the red lines with changing x values
- one for the blue lines with changing y values

And that's exactly what's happening!

```js
// Draw vertical red lines
for (let x = 0; x < width; x += 10) {
  line(x, 0, x, height)
}

// Draw horizontal blue lines
for (let y = 0; y < height; y += 10) {
  line(0, y, width, y)
}
```

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/0Oia5Dv8c)

## 3b. Working with Grid Points

The above example is great! But, the most interesting things happen near the _center_ of our canvas, at the intersections of these red and blue lines. How can we access these points in an automated fashion? How might we draw, say, a grid of dots?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eODda031YlnOcuK8Ezl_tqDEGZ-5A7CiZv2TmX3yt8rAuedVzwAjK7kE0ttJAaPQOE7h-bfk9nCy7yTjJYKlcZvw4jfV6j6PEaVQ3_aqmktamVMXM9i6XzdMAMqrC63KgC_2jwqomD4ek3khDZcRkiRQ=s800-no?authuser=0)

To do this, we can put a for loop **inside of a for loop**. A nested for loop!

```js
for(let y = 0; y < height; y += 10) {
  for(let x = 0; x < width; x += 10) {
    circle(x, y, 5)
  }
}
```

- Go down the canvas with y = 0, y = 10, y = 20, ...
- For each y value, draw a row of dots with x = 0, x = 10, x = 20, ...

This is pretty confusing, but it may be more readable if we use a human-readable function name:

```js
for(let y = 0; y < height; y += 10) {
  drawRowOfDots(y)
}

function drawRowOfDots(y) {
  for(let x = 0; x < width; x += 10) {
    circle(x, y, 5)
  }
}
```

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/7sSx7ybrV)

This is saying:

- For each y value (0, 10, 20, 30...), draw a row of dots.
- To draw a row of dots, we take a y value and draw dots at (x=0, x=10, x=20, ...)

Alternatively, we can shift our mental model a bit and think about it in terms of rows and columns. Below, we're drawing a grid of 'a's:

```js
for (let row = 0; row < 6; row += 1) {
  for (let column = 0; column < 6; column += 1) {
    // draw an 'a'
  }
}
```

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c7g9Oy1OFsx8qO8UmCq-95PU-pm_WY6G1yPF-pcAKrWEG5GMagVISAqelMl5_Ateijp68SvWohdnA0d9lK7v5dCKdZzpyyY1p5n8kUNtkKoVOpLKdF_fo8-R-9crO5RLKx-96eVHrSp6DjWiDJdF2d7A=s800-no?authuser=0)

Visually, we may think of these two loops as follows:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cMM4Fsm3zbqIMaGTO7hXFJiT8kt5-PGOCSm-t1hPuCGobtwfTyf-x8y9hp_EX1Dh-9H0sL0bWaj6WSw4nZu633lrsjRJ2rpThv5gTYVANz4Z_XY98yIJThXkXAGmkKx7vu9anSJjScaPkG8fYzXDqkvA=w1588-h1096-no?authuser=0)

- row starts at 0 and column loops through 0 --> 5. 
- Once it's done, the "inner" for-loop ends and we increment `row`. (row += 1)
- We start a new inner for-loop, where column goes from 0 --> 5.
- We increment row again. (row += 1)
- repeat until done :)

If you create for-loops in this manner, you may notice some differences in positioning. In particular, we need to do some math to space grid points properly:

```js
for (let row = 0; row < 6; row += 1) {
  for (let column = 0; column < 6; column += 1) {
    let x = row * 10    // grid points are 10 pixels apart
    let y = column * 10 // grid points are 10 pixels apart
    circle (x, y, 5)
  }
}
```

When modifying x and y directly as we were doing before, we can just use it:

```js
for(let y = 0; y < height; y += 10) {
  for(let x = 0; x < width; x += 10) {
    circle(x, y, 5)
  }
}
```

## 4. Molnar, automated

Once we're at this point, we can talk again about our Molnar Squares! Since we are interested in a 3x3 grid of squares, we can use a nested for-loop to build our composition.

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/7_Vibctrt)

This sketch uses a for-loop, but also harnesses the power of variables (in the vein of Meta Font.) This shows us the power of automation as it pertains to experimentation!

We have codified the **process** by which Molnar Squares are created, and by abstracting a few variables like:

- the number of rows/columns (`numRows`, `numCols`)
- and how big our squares are based on the number of rows/columns (`squareLength`)

We can now play around with different densities of square grid compositions. I recommend changing the number of rows/columns and seeing what happens!

## 5. Strings as Lists

Briefly, I mentioned that you can define lists of values in JavaScript ("arrays").

```js
let yValues = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
```

This is of interest for text as well! We can think of text like `"apple"` as being a list of characters:

```js
let chars = ["a", "p", "p", "l", "e"]
// same as let chars = "apple".split("")
```

Which means we can iterate over them with for loops:

```js
for (let char in chars) {
  console.log(char)
}

// a
// p
// p
// l
// e
```

or pick out individual characters based on their position:

```js
let num = 0
for (let column = 0; column < 6; column += 1) {
  // Get a character based on position.
  let char = chars[num]
  
  // Draw the character.
  let x = ...
  let y = ...
  text(char, x, y)

  // Go to the next character, wrapping back to the first character if needed.
  num = (num + 1) % chars.length
}
```

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/krlk_bQaS)

We can even randomly pick values out of a list:

```js
for (let column = 0; column < 6; column += 1) {
  let char = random(chars)
}
```

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/6cHMtqMX7)


## 6. Images as Grids of Pixels

To get you thinking of how to go from images --> ASCII art, we should talk about accessing images. Images can be considered a grid of pixels:

![](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs/pixel_grid0.jpg)

Which means we can access pixel values at an (x, y) position:

```js
img.get(x, y)
```

and get values from it, like brightness:

```js
colorMode(HSB, 255)

let pixel = img.get(x, y)
let brightness = brightness(pixel)

// Brightness is between 0 and 255
```

In this way, we can think about a program that might:

1. Load an image.
2. Resize it to fit the canvas.
3. Loop over every pixel value, and draw it on the canvas with a rectangle.

[Sketch Example](https://editor.p5js.org/kyeah/sketches/yvm447xyv)

You might think of it like a scanner, scanning each line and digitizing it :)
