## Course Description

In our modern world, the ‚Äòglitch‚Äô can be found everywhere.  The idea of the ‚Äòglitch‚Äô as art is ripe with history that has involved experimentation in a myriad of forms. Meanwhile, the proliferation of new tools and frameworks to aid in visual coding on the web has become easier than ever, opening the doors for creatives to explore the space of font structures and layouts in new and radical ways. 

This area of experimentation seems ripe for creatives wanting to explore the concepts of glitch aesthetics and data bending. What if a letterform could be affected by sound? What happens when you manipulate the raw components of a font? What new ideas can we gain from breaking away from pixel-perfect intentionality?

P5.js will be the main programming library for the course, a beginner-friendly Javascript framework. Students who are new to programming are welcome. Techniques covered in this course will include building visual compositions with code, manipulating pixel and vector data, and implementing them in real-time applications on the browser.

During the course of four evenings, there will be weekly lectures and demonstrations on different algorithmic concepts. Students will be expected to complete weekly assignments to solidify their understanding and create typographic projects of a computational nature.
